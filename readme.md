Mr. Pine Cone - A simple personal website theme
========

This is a static Bootstrap-based HTML theme for a simple personal website, inspired by [about.me](http://about.me). It's created with [Pinegrow Web Editor](http://pinegrow.com).

[Visit the demo page](https://pinegrow.github.io/MrPineCone/)

The theme is Pinegrow CMS-ready. That means that it has editable areas that can be easily edited with Pinegrow in CMS mode.

Using the theme
-----

### With Pinegrow:

1. Download the theme.
2. Use Pinegrow to edit the content and CSS styles.
3. Upload the website to any server, GitHub pages or another hosting provider - it's just a HTML site. No need to upload pinegrow.json, _pgbackup folders and readme.md.
4. Optionally, let the end-user edit the page with Pinegrow in CMS mode.

### Without Pinegrow:

1. Download the theme.
2. It's just HTML and CSS, so you can use any code editor or tool to customise the page.
